(**In progress**, still working on it...)

This template is mostly made for beginners in order to start simple react project faster. It's pre-configured with a minimal set of simple tools.\
I strongly recommand you explore those differents tools repo and/or website so you can learn how to use them to their best. 

For the backend, you'll find a `SQL` branch <sub><sup>( MySQL )</sup></sub> and a `NoSQL` one <sub><sup>( MongoDB )</sup></sub>. 

You'll find all instructions and links below. 

### Project Initialization

- In **VSCode**, install plugins [Prettier - Code formatter](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint) and configure them.
- Clone this repo, enter it.
- Use `git checkout mysql` OR `git checkout mongodb` to access the setup you need.
- Delete `.git` and initialize a new one (see below).
- Run command `npm install`.
- Run command `npm run dev` in each directory `backend` & `frontend`.
- Create environment files (`.env`) in both `backend` and `frontend`: you can copy `.env.sample` files as starters.

- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
- [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)

## Frontend

- Clean `App.jsx`
    - including homepage route using [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- `App.scss` reset
- Custom [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) properties & utilities `.styles/_utilities.scss`
    - Sass is included in this project. If you want to use vscode extension like [Live Sass Compiler](https://github.com/glenn2223/vscode-live-sass-compiler), or don't use it at all, feel free to `npm uninstall sass`.
    -  .gitignore containing `**.css.map` <sub><sup>( in case of vscode extension )</sup></sub>
- `pages`, `components`, `styles` directories.

## Backend 

- `server.js` including express app, basic routes & middlewares.
- `routes` directory.

> (`chmod -R +w .` might be necessary)
